RAM vs ROM

RAM Random Access Memory
The information stored in this type of memory is lost when the power supply to device is switched off.
It is generally known as main memory or volatile memory of the computer system.

RAM Types
DRAM   -> Dynamic RAM
SRAM   -> Static RAM
SDRAM  -> Synchronous Dynamic RAM high clock speed
DDR


ROM Read Only Memory
It is permanent type of memory.
Its content are not lost when the power supply to device is switched off.
The computer manufacturer decides the information in ROM, and its permanently stored at the time of manufacturing, 
which cannot be overwritten by the user.

ROM Types
EPROM    -> Erasable Programmable Read only memory, can be earased by exposing the memory to ultraviolet light
EEPROM   -> Electrically Erasable Programmable Read only memory , it stores and deletes instruction on speacial circuit
PROM     -> Programmable Read only memory, written using a particular device
Mask ROM -> MROM -> contents can be programmed by integrated circuit manufacturer



Characterstics of RAM
RAM chips are used in the normal operations of a computer for starting and loading os and applications.
Much faster than read from and write type memory

Characterstics of ROM
Data can be written only once. However, once written can be read any number of times.
It is used mainly in the startup process of computer.
