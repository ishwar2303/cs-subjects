Program 
A program is set of instructions to perform specific operations.

Process
A process is program in execution that allows you to perform appropriate actions in a program.
It can be defined as execution unit where a program runs.
OS create, schedule and terminates the processes.
A process operations can be easily controlled with the help of PCB (Process Control Block).
It contains all the crucial information such as process id, priority, state, content etc.

Thread 
It is a segment/part of a process.
A process can have multiple threads, all executing at the same time.
It is fundamental basic unit of CPU utilization.
It helps to improve the performance uisng parallelism as it is lightweight which can be easily schedulded.
Multiple threads share information like data, files, code etc.

Process takes more time for context switching than threads.
Process doesn't share data whereas threads share data with each other.

Properties of process
-> Creation of each process require separate system calls for each process.
-> It is an isolated execution unit that doesn't share data
-> Processes use the IPC(Inter-Process communication)
-> A process has its stack, heap memory and data map.

Properties of Thread
-> Single system call can create more than one thread.
-> Thread share data and information.
-> Threads shares instructions, global and heap regions. However, it has its register and stack.
-> Communication between threads can be achieved using shared memory


Multithreading
It refers to multiple thread execution within an operating system.
In simple terms two or more threads of a same process executing at the same time.

Why multithreading
Multithreading leads to maximum CPU utilization by multitasking.
